# Admin Dashboard v1

This feature provides administrative access and control to the CornucopiaStrategy system.

## Core Features
- Admin-only access
- Mailerlite API integration to retrieve subscriber fields
- Field mapping to `tblformdatanew`
- Full CRUD interface for `tblformdatanew`
- Search, sort, and pagination (25/50/100 rows)
- Row selection for editing
- Colored row display for easy visual scanning
- Scheduler toggle (simulate on/off state)
- Inline testing of scripts
- Modular-ready design for expanding the dashboard

## Placeholder Note
This folder includes placeholder files in `placeholder_common/` that simulate access to shared logic.

Do not modify or remove placeholders. Final integration will replace them with actual shared code from `common/`.
